## 15 Governing Law; Arbitration and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver

---

### 15.1 Governing Law
You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in Western Australia (Australia); and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to person jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Western Australia. These Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Western Australia, with respect to the Inconsistency of Laws (Constitution Cth, V.109).  The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Not withstanding the preceding sentences, where applicable, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission may be used as an arbiter of these Terms.

### 15.2 Arbitration
READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US. This Section 14.2 (the “**Arbitration Agreement**”) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and Us that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (a) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (b) access to or use of the Service, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (c) any transactions through, by, or using the Service; or (d) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with Us, directly or indirectly, as a consumer (“**Claim**” or collectively, “**Claims**”). The Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your agreement to this Agreement.

If you are a new Service user, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of accepting these Terms by emailing Us at [EMAIL HERE] with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.

For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at [ant.ai.idantifier@gmail.com](mailto://ant.ai.idantifier@gmail.com) and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that We has not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by ACCC before a single arbitrator (the “**Arbitrator**”), under the Expedited Procedures then in effect for ACCC (the “**Rules**”), except as provided herein.  In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control.  ACCC may be contacted at [www.accc.gov.au](https://www.accc.gov.au/), where the Rules are also available. The arbitration will be conducted in the State of Australia where you live or Western Australia, unless you and Us agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any ACCC filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with ACCC rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) ACCC may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from ACCC; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Us agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether any provision of these Terms is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.

Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as: preventing the Harry Butler Institute from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights; or preventing you from asserting claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.  

If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in force, or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver in Section 15.2 is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction.  All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.

### 15.3 Class Action / Jury Trial Waiver
WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AND US AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).  ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER SERVICE USERS. YOU AND US FURTHER AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND US ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER.
